            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol><li>In a small bowl, dissolve 2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar in 1 1/2 cups of warm water.
                 Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 to 4 cups of all-purpose flour
                  and 2 teaspoons of salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.Mix until
                   the dough comes together, then turn it out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and
                    elastic.Add more flour if the dough is too sticky.Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth
                     or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
                
                     <li>In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add 2 minced garlic cloves and sauté until
                         fragrant.Add 1 can (14-16 oz) of crushed tomatoes, 1 teaspoon each of dried oregano and basil, and salt and
                          pepper to taste. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let it cool.</li>
                   
                          <li>
                            Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>

                    <li>
                        Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions.
                         Roll each portion into a ball and let them rest for about 10 minutes.
                         On a lightly floured surface, use your hands or a rolling pin to stretch and shape each dough ball into a circle
                          about 12 inches in diameter. If the dough is too elastic, let it rest for a few more minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>If using a pizza peel, sprinkle it with cornmeal to prevent sticking.
                         Transfer the shaped dough to the peel or a baking sheet.Spread a thin layer of the prepared tomato sauce
                          over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.Sprinkle 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese evenly
                           over the sauce. Add any desired toppings, such as pepperoni, sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives,
                            etc.</li>

                            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza from the peel onto the stone. If using a baking sheet,
                                 place it in the oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly
                                  and slightly browned.</li>

                                  <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Optionally, brush the crust
                                     with olive oil and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese or fresh basil leaves.Use a pizza cutter
                                      to slice the pizza and serve immediately. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
